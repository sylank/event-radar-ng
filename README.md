## Description

Here you can find an Angular 5 visual component. This component looks like a diagram or a chart but here you can show nearby events. You can configure it with a Json file.
We have a summer house and i want to create a fancy website. I will use this radar diagram to show the nearby static events like a spa or a park or a mountain hike program.

Here you can see the diagram in action (this is a mock design, this is not real webpage):
